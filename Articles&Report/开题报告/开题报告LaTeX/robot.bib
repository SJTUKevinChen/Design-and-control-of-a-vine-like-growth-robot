  abstract = {The robotics community has seen an exponential growth in the level of complexity of the theoretical tools presented for the modeling of soft robotics devices. Different solutions have been presented to overcome the difficulties related to the modeling of soft robots, often leveraging on other scientific disciplines, such as continuum mechanics, computational mechanics, and computer graphics. These theoretical and computational foundations are often taken for granted and this leads to an intricate literature that, consequently, has rarely been the subject of a complete review. For the first time, we present here a structured overview of all the approaches proposed so far to model soft robots. The chosen classification, which is based on their theoretical and numerical grounds, allows us to provide a critical analysis about their uses and applicability. This will enable robotics researchers to learn the basics of these modeling techniques and their associated numerical methods, but also to have a critical perspective on their uses.},

  abstract = {Continuum and soft robots can leverage complex actuator shapes to take on useful shapes while actuating only a few of their many degrees of freedom. Continuum robots that also grow increase the range of potential shapes that can be actuated and enable easier access to constrained environments. Existing models for describing the complex kinematics involved in general actuation of continuum robots rely on simulation or wellbehaved stress\textendash strain relationships, but the nonlinear behavior of the thin-walled inflated-beams used in growing robots makes these techniques difficult to apply. Here, we derive kinematic models of single, generally routed tendon paths on a soft pneumatic backbone of inextensible but flexible material from geometric relationships alone. This allows for forward modeling of the resulting shapes with only knowledge of the geometry of the system. We show that this model can accurately predict the shape of the whole robot body and how the model changes with actuation type. We also demonstrate the use of this kinematic model for inverse design, where actuator designs are found based on desired final robot shapes. We deploy these designed actuators on soft pneumatic growing robots to show the benefits of simultaneous growth and shape change.},

  abstract = {Tip-extending soft robots that ``grow'' via pneumatic eversion of their body material have demonstrated applications in exploration of cluttered environments. During growth, the motion and force of the robot tip can be controlled in three degrees of freedom using actuators that direct the tip in combination with extension. However, when reversal of the growth process is attempted by retracting the internal body material from the base, the robot body often responds by buckling rather than inverting the body material, making control of tip motion and force impossible. We present and validate a model to predict when buckling occurs instead of inversion, and introduce an electromechanical device that can be added to a tip-extending soft robot to prevent buckling during retraction, restoring the ability of steering actuators to control the robot's motion and force during inversion. Using our retraction device, we demonstrate three previously impossible tasks: exploring different branches of a forking path, reversing growth while applying minimal force on the environment, and bringing back environment samples to the base without disturbing the environment.},

In particular, natural environments that contain granular media present a variety of challenges for the design and control of robots. Recently, everting vine robots have been demonstrated that can navigate many different environments, including digging in sand. However, everting vine robots typically rely on a tether which limits their ability to explore. Here we present an untethered, continuously everting soft robot for exploration in granular media. We test the ability of this design to reduce the drag on the robot while moving through granular media. We then investigate design features to improve the ability of the robot to generate thrust in granular media, and validate them experimentally.

This paper presents an approach for design optimization of such robots to reach specified targets while minimizing the number of discrete joints and thus construction and actuation costs. We define a maximum number of allowable joints, as well as hardware constraints imposed by the materials and actuation available for soft growing robots, and we formulate and solve an optimization problem to output a planar robot design, i.e., the total number of potential joints and their locations along the robot body, which reaches all the desired targets, avoids known obstacles, and maximizes the workspace. We demonstrate a process to rapidly construct the resulting soft growing robot design. Finally, we use our algorithm to evaluate the ability of this design to reach new targets and demonstrate the algorithm's utility as a design tool to explore robot capabilities given various constraints and objectives.},

  abstract = {Navigation and motion control of a robot to a destination are tasks that have historically been performed with the assumption that contact with the environment is harmful. This makes sense for rigid-bodied robots, where obstacle collisions are fundamentally dangerous. However, because many soft robots have bodies that are low-inertia and compliant, obstacle contact is inherently safe. As a result, constraining paths of the robot to not interact with the environment is not necessary and may be limiting. In this article, we mathematically formalize interactions of a soft growing robot with a planar environment in an empirical kinematic model. Using this interaction model, we develop a method to plan paths for the robot to a destination. Rather than avoiding contact with the environment, the planner exploits obstacle contact when beneficial for navigation. We find that a planner that takes into account and capitalizes on environmental contact produces paths that are more robust to uncertainty than a planner that avoids all obstacle contact.},

Unlike a traditional tendon driven continuum robot, the robot is entirely soft and contains no hard components, making it safer for human interaction. Models of both the sPAM and soft continuum robot kinematics are presented and experimentally verified. We found a mean position accuracy of 5.5 cm for predicting the end-effector position of a 42 cm long robot with the kinematic model.

However, environmental contact can drastically alter the motion of continuum robots, complicating their control in these applications. Here we describe the design, modeling, and control of a soft continuum robot with a novel extension degree-of-freedom that enables movement in a direction that is always tangent to the robot's backbone, independent of environmental contacts. Steering occurs by inflating multiple Series Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (sPAMs) arranged radially around the backbone and extending along the robot's whole length. This design simplifies navigation of the robot by decoupling steering and extension. To navigate to a destination, the robot is steered to point at the destination, and the extension degree-of-freedom is used to reach it. We present models and experimentally verify the sPAMs and growing robot kinematics. The kinematic model has a mean position accuracy of 5.5 cm for predicting the tip position of a 42 cm long robot.

  abstract = {Everting, soft growing vine robots benefit from reduced friction with their environment, which allows them to navigate challenging terrain. Vine robots can use air pouches attached to their sides for lateral steering. However, when all pouches are serially connected, the whole robot can only perform one constant curvature in free space. It must contact the environment to navigate through obstacles along paths with multiple turns. This work presents a multi-segment vine robot that can navigate complex paths without interacting with its environment. This is achieved by a new steering method that selectively actuates each single pouch at the tip, providing high degrees of freedom with few control inputs. A small magnetic valve connects each pouch to a pressure supply line. A motorized tip mount uses an interlocking mechanism and motorized rollers on the outer material of the vine robot. As each valve passes through the tip mount, a permanent magnet inside the tip mount opens the valve so the corresponding pouch is connected to the pressure supply line at the same moment. Novel cylindrical pneumatic artificial muscles (cPAMs) are integrated into the vine robot and inflate to a cylindrical shape for improved bending characteristics compared to other state-of-the-art vine robots. The motorized tip mount controls a continuous eversion speed and enables controlled retraction. A final prototype was able to repeatably grow into different shapes and hold these shapes. We predict the path using a model that assumes a piecewise constant curvature along the outside of the multi-segment vine robot. The proposed multi-segment steering method can be extended to other soft continuum robot designs.},

However, existing soft continuum robots are of great challenges in achieving multiple, mutually independent, and on-demand active steering over a long distance without precise steering control. In this paper, we introduce a vine-like soft robot made up of a pressurized thin-walled vessel integrated with the high controllability of a control system with multiple degrees of freedom in three dimensions. Moreover, steering and kinematic models to relate the steering angle and robot length to the location of the robot tip are provided, and a dynamic finite element model for analyzing the motion of the spatial consecutive steering is established. We demonstrate the abilities of disinfection of the robot moving in a long and tortuous pipeline and detection in a multi-obstacle constrained environment. It is established that the robot exhibits great advantages in active consecutive steering over a long distance, high controllability in completing more complex path planning, and significant ability of carrying operational tools for ventilation pipeline disinfection and multi-obstacle detection. The bionic soft robot shows great promise for use in environment sensing, target detecting, and equipment servicing.},

The soft origami design and mechanism can meet many of these beneficial factors; however, achieving a high payload capacity remains challenging. In this letter, we developed a soft origami arm module with high variable stiffness (x300) and spatial efficiency (compressed x3.1). The buckling of facets into a cylindrical tube followed by its pressurization enables the arm to be highly stiffened. High-pressure capacity was obtained via the sewing-heat press fabrication process. We used a pneumatic pressure\textendash tendon pair and utilized the frictional force between origami and tendon to prevent unintentional gravity-induced deformation while deploying. An analytical model was developed and compared to the experimental results. With our modular design, we could easily build functional robotic structures. Two robotic demonstrations were performed to examine the expandability of the modules. A variable-length robotic arm that mimics a human arm was built to manipulate typical objects. Additionally, a soft rover, which could carry 14 kg of weight and change its volume 29 times for improved spatial efficiency, was developed. This research suggests a new design methodology for practical soft robotic systems.},

Many of these spaces contain three-dimensional passageways and uneven terrain that pose challenges for robot design and control. Everting toroidal robots, which move via simultaneous eversion and inversion of their body material, are promising for navigation in these types of spaces. We present a novel soft everting toroidal robot that propels itself using a motorized device inside an air-filled membrane. Our robot requires only a single control signal to move, can conform to its environment, and can climb vertically with a motor torque that is independent of the force used to brace the robot against its environment. We derive and validate models of the forces involved in its motion, and we demonstrate the robot's ability to navigate a maze and climb a pipe.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the use of fabric to manufacture and integrate soft actuators and sensors into wearable robots elucidates the benefits of soft robotic technology, closing the gap between humans and machines. However, many limitations in terms of ease of manufacturing, customization, modeling, output force and control remain unsolved and reduce the number of practical applications of fabric-based soft robotic systems. To address these limitations, we propose the use of laser-cut fabric shells laminated onto thermoplastic polyurethane as a pneumatic bending soft actuator. In this letter the design, fabrication, modeling, and control of a fabric shelled bending actuator is presented. Our experiments suggest that the fabric-shelled actuators are highly tunable and usable for high force applications. Moreover, the finite element model developed can predict the behavior of different fabric shelled actuator designs. Finally, we show how precise control of the actuators can be achieved by the implementation of a feedback curvature control system.},

  abstract = {Snake robots are characterized by their ability to navigate through small spaces and loose terrain by utilizing efficient cyclic forms of locomotion. Soft snake robots are a subset of these robots which utilize soft, compliant actuators to produce movement. Prior work on soft snake robots has primarily focused on planar gaits, such as undulation. More efficient spatial gaits, such as sidewinding, are unexplored gaits for soft snake robots. We propose a novel means of constructing a soft snake robot capable of sidewinding, and introduce the Helical Inflating Soft Snake Robot (HISSbot). We validate this actuation through the physical HISSbot, and demonstrate its ability to sidewind across various surfaces. Our tests show robustness in locomotion through low-friction and granular media.},

  abstract = {Electrocorticography (ECoG) is a minimally invasive approach frequently used clinically to map epileptogenic regions of the brain and facilitate lesion resection surgery and increasingly explored in brain-machine interface applications. Current devices display limitations that require trade-offs among cortical surface coverage, spatial electrode resolution, aesthetic, and risk consequences and often limit the use of the mapping technology to the operating room. In this work, we report on a scalable technique for the fabrication of large-area soft robotic electrode arrays and their deployment on the cortex through a square-centimeter burr hole using a pressure-driven actuation mechanism called eversion. The deployable system consists of up to six prefolded soft legs, and it is placed subdurally on the cortex using an aqueous pressurized solution and secured to the pedestal on the rim of the small craniotomy. Each leg contains soft, microfabricated electrodes and strain sensors for real-time deployment monitoring. In a proof-of-concept acute surgery, a soft robotic electrode array was successfully deployed on the cortex of a minipig to record sensory cortical activity. This soft robotic neurotechnology opens promising avenues for minimally invasive cortical surgery and applications related to neurological disorders such as motor and sensory deficits.           ,              Soft robotic actuation with bioelectronics were combined to develop minimally invasive, deployable cortical electrode arrays.},

  abstract = {Soft robots that grow through eversion/apical extension can effectively navigate fragile environments such as ducts and vessels inside the human body. This letter presents the physicsbased model of a miniature steerable eversion growing robot. We demonstrate the robot's growing, steering, stiffening and interaction capabilities. The interaction between two robot-internal components is explored, i.e., a steerable catheter for robot tip orientation, and a growing sheath for robot elongation/retraction. The behavior of the growing robot under different inner pressures and external tip forces is investigated. Simulations are carried out within the SOFA framework. Extensive experimentation with a physical robot setup demonstrates agreement with the simulations. The comparison demonstrates a mean absolute error of 10\textendash 20\% between simulation and experimental results for curvature values, including catheter-only experiments, sheath-only experiments and full system experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explore physics-based modelling of a tendon-driven steerable eversion growing robot. While our work is motivated by early breast cancer detection through mammary duct inspection and uses our MAMMOBOT robot prototype, our approach is general and relevant to similar growing robots.},
